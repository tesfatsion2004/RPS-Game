# RPS-Game


This is ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS Game: Main features of the Application include the following:

    It is built using html, css and javascript technologies.
    The game assumes there is a user playing against the computer.
    Three languages (English and two other local Ethiopian languages namely Tigrinya and English)

Lessons learnt:

    Practice driven html, css and javascript constructs
    Algorithmic web programming skills in general

I can't emphasize enough that skills development includes simultaneously learning, practicing and being as the saying goes "Practice makes perfect". It is my recommendation for any beginner programmer to do it, not reading it only.

You can add more funny things or features to the scope being covered link making it an online multiplayer game. In an attempt to fill gaps identified, real learning happens.

Just do it.

I give credit to ..... I will put the name of an excellent developer who thought me doing this.
